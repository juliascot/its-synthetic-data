# Using Tensor Factorization to Generate Synthetic Data for eduRange (Intelligent Tutoring System)

The goal of this project is to take in log data, process it into a usable format, use tensor factorization to extract the latent features, and use an adjusted GAN to generate more data. I will then compare an ML model trained on the original data to an ML model trained on the synthetic data.
