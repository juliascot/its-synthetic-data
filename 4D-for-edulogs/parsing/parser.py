# FIRST PASS THROUGH: put timestamps, user number, commands in
# Organize milestones, consider compromises
# Manually go through and mark up which milestone I believe students were working on (using EDUQuestions, their logs, and milestones)
# Write ML program/use SLM to classify which ones
# Compare the results qualitatively and quantitatively

# SECOND PASS THROUGH: use standardized program to say which milestone each student was working towards, marking if they got it right or wrong (retain commands and doublecheck)

# THIRD PASS THROUGH: number the attempts on each milestone according to timestamp (removing commands)

# FOURTH PASS THROUGH: rearrange students for better anonymization
